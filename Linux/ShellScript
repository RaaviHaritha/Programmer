Shell Script Programs:

It behaves as command line interpreter to Linux.
The files having extensions:
1  ".sh"
2  ".bash"
    -->We will these extensions to create shell script file.

	
Every program shouls start with :
                        
          #!/bin/bash    (or)
          #!/bin/sh

To run script:

     By default Linux removes all the executable permission.To run a shell script we have to give permission for execution.
