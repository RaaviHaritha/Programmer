TCP & IP:


	Transmission control Protocol:
					  Responsible for transferring of the data betweeen the source and destination.
   	It packes the data into frames called data frame. In the successful transfer of data from source to destination,
	there should be a person who takes care of it ,that person is called TCP.


	Internet Protocol:
			The IP takes care of the responsibility to choose the shortest path or way for transferring.


ARCHIVAL:

	It will group all the files into a one and then transfer to destination.Memory is still same after grouping them
	also. It will not a compression tecnique ,it is different.


COMPRESSION TECHNIQUE:


		It comprises the files, so that the memory is reduced.To perform this we have techniques which are differ
	from OS to OS.

	For Windows:
		In windows we have compression technique called zip, it is default for windows.
		
	For Linux:
		In Linux also we have zip technique, but the default technique is tar.
		The techniques are:
			1.tar.gz
			2.tar.bz2


	To apply ZIP :
		cmd: zip <archivename> files names which are to be zipped
			Ex: zip hari.zip f1 f2
        To UNZIP:
		cmd: unzip <archivename>
			Ex: unzip hari.zip
 


Commands for TAR:


		Flags:
		  --> -c : Create a new archive
		  --> -v : Verbose output
				Display all the contents that goes into archival
		  --> -f : Use archive file as name
		  --> -z : Apply the compression technique (gzip).
		  --> -j : Apply the compression technique (bzip2).
		  --> -t : List all the contents in an archive.
		  --> -x : Extract of all files from the archive
			
	Archival:
                
     	 	To create:
 		cmd: tar -cvf archivename.tar files to be added.
                      --> tar hari.tar f1 f2 f3
                              // An archive is created with files f1,f2,f3.
		To Extract:
		cmd: tar -xf archivename
			// files are extracted from the archival.

	
	tar.gz:

		To create: 
		cmd:tar -cvzf archivename.tar.gz <files>

		To extract:
		cmd: tar -xzf archivename.tar.gz

	tar.bz2:
		
		To create:
		cmd: tar -cvjf archivename.tar.bz <files>

		To extract:
		cmd: tar -xjf archivename.tar.bz
