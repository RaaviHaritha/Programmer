VI EDITOR:
	We can create a file with content.And also we can modify of the content of the file which is already exist.
	
	There are many editors:
		Elvis 
		Nvi
		nano
		vile etc..
    	The modified version of vi editor is "VIM".It is the easiest and preferable editor.
	
	In this we have two modes:
		1.command mode
		2.insert mode
	

	1.Command Mode:
		Once we enter into editor it is by default open in a command mode.Here what we text is considered as a 
		command.
		The commands are:
		
			--> esc : Comes out of the insert mode and goes into command mode. 
			--> i   : Comes out of command mode and goes into inser mode.
			--> dd  : Deletes the current line where the cursor is pointing (entire).
			--> u   : Undo the last changes.
			--> U   : Undo all changes to entire file.
			--> o   : open a new line.
			--> 3dd : It deletes three lines from the cursor.
			--> D   : Delete the total content after the cursor.
			--> C   : Delete the contents of a line after the cursor and takes input as well. Use esc or q to 
				  exit from this input insertion mode.
			--> dw  : delete a word at the cursor.
			--> 4dw : delete four words from the cursor.
			--> cw  : change the word.
			--> x   : Delete the character.
			--> r   : replace the character.
			--> gg  : Take your cursor to the first character of your file.
			--> dG  : Delete all the text inside a file.

 
			esc + : + w        --> It comes out of insert mode and save the content.
			esc + : + q        --> It exit from the editor without saving the content.
			esc + : + w + q    --> It comes out of editor by saving the text.
			esc + shift + zz   --> It also comes out of editor by saving the text in it.

				"But esc + : + w + q" --> It is preferrable.

	
	2.Insert Mode:
		In the insert mode we can give input to the file. "i" command is used to enter into inser mode.
		everything you type consider as text.
