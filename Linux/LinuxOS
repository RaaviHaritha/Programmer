Linux Operating System:
        
             The linux operating system is an open source operating system. In this the file system is arrranged in an 
  heirarichal manner. The very first node is /(root). Every file can be accessed through this root node only.
     
              An Example view of the linux file system:

                                                           /

                                          bin   etc  boot   dev  root  lib  home   media
    
          Like this the linux-file-system is arranged. If we want to access the folder 'boot' then we go for the "/boot".
     In this way the other folders can be  accessed or navigated.
